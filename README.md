# Integrated-Employee-Management-System
This project involves designing and implementing a database system to manage comprehensive employee information for an organization. The system tracks key details such as:

Employee Information: Personal and professional details of employees.
Departments: Departmental structures and assignments.
Salaries: Salary components and payroll details.
Attendance and Leaves: Employee attendance records and leave management.
Performance Reviews: Evaluations and development plans.
Training Programs: Employee training and skill development initiatives.
The database schema is normalized to optimize data integrity and storage. It includes Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), relational schemas, and SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting sample data, and generating reports.

This project provides a robust foundation for managing employee data, generating integrated reports, and supporting organizational decision-making through SQL queries.
